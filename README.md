# diceRoller

You can use this script to roll any number of any non standard die.

Running the code in a command line should allow you to choose any number of dice and any type of die.

When answering an input question in the terminal you need to surround your answer with ''.
For example, when answering the question:
"Do you want to roll some dice?
Yes or No?"
Your response should be:
'Yes'
or
'No'
Case does not matter. Infact, only the first letter actually matters, so:
'y'
or
'Y'
or
'ya man'
will all continue the program. 

The output will give you each individual die's output as well as the total you have rolled.
